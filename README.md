* books marked to read by the users
* book metadata (author, year, etc.) 
* tags/shelves/genres

## Access

Some of these files are quite large, so GitHub won't show their contents online. See [samples/](samples/) for smaller CSV snippets.

Open the [notebook](quick_look.ipynb) for a quick look at the data. Download individual zipped files from [releases](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/releases).
